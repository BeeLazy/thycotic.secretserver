# Introduction

Welcome to the home of the Thycotic Secret Server PowerShell module. This module utilizes the REST API to allow you to manage things in Secret Server.

This module is managed and maintained by Professional Services.

# Installation

Primary means to install the module is via the PowerShell Gallery. The module is released at this time as a pre-release. So you **will need** [PowerShellGet module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget) 2.2.4 or higher.

## Limitations

The limitations of the module is at the mercy of the REST API endpoints (for the most part). As the module expands I'm working on feature requests to make things a viable option for the module as well.

In certain functions, in order to accomplish certain tasks it may utilize multiple endpoints so those are things you as the user will not have to deal with in your scripts.

# Documentation

Each function will include comment-based help.

Online documentation: TBD

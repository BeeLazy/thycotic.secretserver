# Introduction

Welcome to the Thycotic Secret Server PowerShell module. This module utilizes the REST API to manage and use the Secrets managed by Secret Server in your automation tooling/scripting. This module is managed and maintained by Thycotic Professional Services.

> It is currently **out of scope** for Thycotic Support services.

The module's goal is to give users a more accessible starting point working with the Secret Server's REST API. The best effort is made to have a similar workflow with the UI to plan out the functions and tasks you need to perform.
